# REFLECTIONS ABOUT MY QUARTER 1 EXPERIENCE!

1. Loops, Arrays, Usage of JavaScript and HTML, and finally lessons about HTML and its functions.
2. Same as all of the above, all I need to read is about how and when they can work.
3. Watching Coding from different creators and chat gpt if needed.
4. Effective - Meal Tax and Service Charge, and Friends List. UnEffective - NONE AND NONE!!! I think all activites is effective to learn for students if they listen and closely understand. Using Chat GPT is also a viable option due to which it can point out the mistakes in your code.

## Hey this is only Quarter 1! My CS3 experience might be better!!
